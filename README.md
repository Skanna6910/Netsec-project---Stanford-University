INTRODUCTION:
 In this project, an exploitation is performed on a vulnerable network infrastructure and network servives. It includes exploitation of FTP, SSH and SMB services using industry-standard exploits. A comprehensive final report is submitted on the vulnerabilties in the given vulnerable network infratsructure virtual machine.

OVERVIEW:
 A basic understanding of OSI layers, TCP/IP protocol layer and network packets capturing using Wireshark is accomplished. Port and Service Scanning includes the following:

  ◘ Understanding of common ports and running services such as SMB, telnet, and SSH.
  
  ◘ Scanning of running services and ports using Nmap.
  
  ◘ Usage of different scanning techniques
  
  ◘ Service-based and operating system scanning
  
  ◘ Nmap script-based scanning technique

LEARNING OUTCOME & MACHINES USED: 
 As a result, I was able to perform various techniques of network-based vulnerability assessment and penetration testing. They will be able to exploit vulnerable services and/or configuration using various tools. Machines used were:

 • Oracle Virtual box
 • Metasploitable Virtual machine
 • Kali Linux Virtual Machine
